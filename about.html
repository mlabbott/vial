<h2>Belladona Thorne, Owner</h2>
<img src="images/meghan.jpg">
<br><br><br><br>
<p> A proud Hogwarts Alumni, Belladonna Thorne opened The Venemous Vial after the urging of her mentor, the illustrious Horace Slughorn. A member of The Slug Club back in her youth, Ms. Thorne also held the title of Gryffindor chaser and prefect. </p>

<p>After graduating from Hogwarts, Belladonna worked briefly for the Ministry of Magic in the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, but soon found her calling in running her own business. In her spare time, she is an activist for S.P.E.W. and supports equality for werewolves. She makes it a point to hire house elves that have been freed and wish to work for compensation, and hopes to spread the message about the right to freedom for house eleves throughout the rest of the magical community.</p> 
<p>
Belladonna also enjoys visiting dragons in Romania, and attending the Quidditch World Cup every four years. When she is not traveling or working in the shop, she likes to spend her time reading books from her vast collection on her front porch while her cats chase the garden gnomes. </p>
