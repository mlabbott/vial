<h2>Amortentia</h2>
		<img class="saleimg" src="images/amortentia.jpg" alt="Love Potion">
		
		
<p>Amortentia is the world's most powerful love potion. It does not have a distinctive scent, as it smells differently to each person and takes the form
of what he/she finds most attractive. <em>Please take caution</em> when using a love potion; it does not create real love, only intense obsession, and therefore 
can be quite dangerous. Effects are not permanent.</p>

<p><strong>Cost per vial:</strong> 17 sickles, 2 knuts
<br><strong>Cost per cauldron:</strong> 8 galleons, 1 sickle</p>
		
		


<h2>Felix Felicis</h2>
		<img class="saleimg" src="images/felix.jpg" alt="Lucky Potion">
		
<p>Also known as "Liquid Luck", Felix Felicis makes the drinker successful at all they do for a limited amount of time. Beware, taking too much or too often can cause recklessness, overconfidence, and giddiness. Not for use in competitive sports.</p>

<p><strong>Sold Out</strong></p>

<h2>Pepperup Potion</h2>
		<img class="saleimg" src="images/pepperup.jpg" alt="Pepperup Potion">
		<p>Pepperup Potion cures colds, headaches, and the flu. Common side-effects oftentimes include a funnel of steam coming out of one's ears. Not to worry, however, as that usually means it is doing its job.</p>
		
	<p><strong>Cost per vial:</strong> 2 sickles 
<br><strong>Cost per cauldron:</strong> 5 galleons

<h2>Veritaserum</h2>
		<img class="saleimg" src="images/ver.jpg">
		
<p>Veritaserum forces the drinker to tell the truth. While once used in wizarding courts, its use has been deemed inadmissable as it can be fooled by Occlumency. As it is a highly controlled substance by the Ministry of Magic, you must have a notorized letter to order it from The Venemous Vial. No exceptions. </p>
		        
		        
		
<p><strong>Cost per vial:</strong> 10 sickles<br>
