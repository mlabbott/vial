<p> This episode kicks off Belladonna's new series "Back to Basics." This series is meant for beginners, squibs, or those who have been out of the game for awhile and need a refresher course in potion making. The Forgetfulness Potion is an easy concoction for beginners, as it only has three ingredients and is relatively low maintenance.

<p> Episode two is all about the dangers of lazy potion brewing. As a potioneer, you have a responsibility to society to uphold a general sense of morality. Belladonna explains the messiness of playing with love, and the side-effects of indulging in too much liquid luck. These are basic dangers that every beginner should look out for.

<p>This is what a standard pewter cauldron heated to exactly 450 degrees should sound like. If it is not bubbling as excitedly, you must raise the heat.</p>
